# Git Notes Example

With your faction, put together a repository similar to this one. Take care to look at the actual text of the [topics/html.md](./topics/html.md) file to learn how to make a collapsible element.

On Fridays, you will be assigned a few topics that we've covered during the course. With your faction, come up with questions and answers that will help you remember those topics. When coming up with questions, it can be helpful to refer to a resource like [Bloom's Taxonomy](https://www.fractuslearning.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/blooms-taxonomy-verbs-feat-1024x614.png) to come up with challenging questions.

Add your questions and answers to your repository under an appropriate heading. You will then pair up with someone from another faction and you will share questions with one another. Each individual should ask the other five questions before switching. Do this at least twice (a total of ten questions per person) before ending.
